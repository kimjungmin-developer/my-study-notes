## 1. Getting Started
- The major difference between Git and other VCS is the way Git thinks about its data
- Git thinks of its data more like a sereis of snapshots of a miniautre filesystem
- With git, every time you commit, or save the state of your project, Git basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot
- Everything in Git is checksummed before it is stored and is then referred to by that checksum. This means it's impossible to change the contents of any file or directoryt without Git knowing about it
- In fact, Git stores everything in its database not by file name but by the hash value of its contents
- When you do actions in Git, nearly all of them only add data to Git database
- Git has three important states:
  1. Modified: means that you have changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet
  2. Staged: means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot
  3. Committed: means that the data is safely stored in your local database
- If a particular version of a file is in the Git directory, it's considered committed

## 2. Git Basics
- Two ways to get Git Repository:
  1. You can take a local directory that is currently not under version control, and turn it into a Git repository
  2. You can clone an existing Git repository from elsewhere
- This creates a new subdirectory named .git that contains all of your necessary repository files - a Git repository skeleton
- GIT CLONE: Git receives a full copy of nearly all data that the server has. Every version of every file for the history of the project is pulled down by default when you run git clone
- Remember that each file in your working directory can be in one of two states: tracked vs untracked
- tracked files: files that Git knows about
- untracked files: any files in your working directory that were not in your snapshot and are not in your staging area
- a clean working directory = non of your tracked files are modified
- GIT ADD: is a multipurpose command - use it to begin tracking new files, to stage files, and to do other things like marking merge-conflicted files as resolved
- a repository might have a single .gitignore file in its root directory, which applies recursively to the entire repository. However, it is also possible to have additional .gitignore files in subdirectories
- GIT DIFF shows you the exact lines added and removed
```java
mv README.md README = git rm README.md, git add RADME
```
- GIT COMMAND --AMEND: one of the common undos takes place when you commit too early and possibly forget to add some files, or you mess up your commiit message
- GIT FETCH REMOTE, goes out to the remote repository and pulls down all the data from that remote projec that you don't have yet. After you do this, you should have references to all the branches from that remote, which you can merge in to inspect at any time.

## 3. Git Branching
- Branching means you diverge from the main line of development and continue to do work without messing with that main line
- The way Git branches is incredibly lightweight, making branching operations nearly instantaneous, and switching back and forth between branches generally just as fast
- when you make a commit, Git stores a commit object that contains a pointer to the snapshot of the contents that you staged. Commit object contains the author's name, email address, and the message that you typed, and pointers to the commit or commits that diretly came before this commit(its parent or parents)
- Staging files => Checksum for Each File => Store the version of the file in the Git repository as BLOBS
- Building blocks of Git repository: 1. Commit Object 2. A Tree That Points To Blobs(=snapshot) 3.Blob, Checksumed files
![summary](/resources/summary.jpg)
- A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable POINTER to one of these commits. The default branch name in Git is master
![example](/resources/example.jpg)
- Git system can be summarized as manipulating pointers
![pointers](/resources/pointers.jpg)
- GIT LOG will only show commit history below the branch you've checked out(as THE HEAD)
- Git is actually a simple file that contains 40 character SHA-1 checksum of the commit it points to => branches are cheap to create and destroy => Creating a new branch is as quick and simple as writing 41bytes to a file(40 characters and a new line)
- FastForwardMerge: when you try to merge one commit with a commit that can be reached by following the first commit's history, Git simplifies things by moving the pointer forward because there is no divergent work to merge together
- ThreeWayMerge(recursive strategy): Instead of just moving the branch pointer forward, Git creates a new snapshot that results from this three-way merge and automatically creates a new commit that points to it
- GIT ADD: use git add on each file to mark it as conflict-resolved
- GIT BRANCH -V: to see the last commit on each branch, you can run git branch -v
### remotes
- Remote-tracking branch names take the form `<remote>/<branch>`
- For instance if you wanted to see what the master branch on your origin remote looked like as of the last time you communicated with it, you would check the origin/master branch
- Git's clone command automatically names it origin for you, pulls down all its data, creates a pointer to where its master branch is, and names it origin/master locally
- Git also gives you your own local master branch starting at the same place as origin's master branch, so you have something to work from
- To merge from works in github into your current working branch, you can run git merge origin/serverfix. If you want your own serverfix branch that you can work on, you can base it off your remote-tracking branch
- tracking branch = the location from where you fetch git commits
- GIT PUSH --DELETE: you can delete a remote branch using --delete option to git push => ex)git push origin --delete serverfix
## merge vs rebase
- MERGE => THREE WAY MERGE => Performs a three way merge between the two latest branch snapshots (C3 and C4) and the most recent common ancestor of the two, creating a new snapshot(and commit)
- REBASE => looks like FAST FORWARD MERGE => Works by going to the common ancestor of the two branches(the one you're on and the one you're rebasing onto), getting the diff introduced by each commit of the branch you're on, saving those diffs to temporary files, resetting the current branch to the same commit as the branch you are rebasing onto, and finally applying each change in turn to newly made chnages

![vs2](/resources/vs2.jpg) <br>

- If you examine the log of a rebased branch, it looks like a linear history: it appears that all the work happened in series, even when it originally happened in parallel
- Rebasing replays changes from one line of work onto another in the order they were introudced, whereas merging takes the endpoints and merges them together
- When you rebase stuff, you're abandoning exisiting commits and creating new ones that are similar but different
- REBASE vs MERGE: 
  - if (git = record of what actually happened): It's a historical document, valuable in its own right, and shouldn't be tampered with. From this angle, using rebase is like lying about what actually transpired ==> merge
  - if (git = story of how your project was made): you would not publish the first draft of a book and the manual for how to maintain your software, thus git deserves careful editing ==> rebase

## 5. Distributed Git
- In Git, every developer is potentially both a node and a hub; that is, every developer can both contribute code to other repositories and maintain a public repository on which others can base their works and which they can contribute to. This presents a vast range of workflow possibilities for your project and/or your team, so we'll cover a few common paradigms
- Centralized Workflow: One central hub can accept code and everyone synchronizes their work with it. A number of developers are nodes - consumers of that hub - and synchrnoize with that centralized location
- Integration-Manager Workflow: 
  1. The project maintainer pushes to his/her public repository
  2. A contributor clones that repository and makes changes
  3. The contributor pushes to his/her own public copy
  4. The contributor sends the maintainer an email asking them to pull changes
  5. The maintainer adds the contributor's repository as a remote and merges locally
  6. The maintainer pushes merged changes to the main repository
- Commit Guidelines:
  1. Your submissions should not contain any whitespace errors. Git provides an easy way to check for this - before you commit, run git diff --check, which identifies possible whitespace
  2. Get in the habit of creating quality commit messages makes using and collaborating with Git a lot easier. As a general rule, your messages should start with a single line that's no more than 50 charcters and that describes the changes concisely, followed by a blank line, followed by a more detailed explanation
``` java
git push origin master

To jessica@githost:simplegit.git
  1edeee6b..fbff5c master -> master
```
- The message above translates into <oldref>..<newref> fromref -> toref
- oldref = old reference, newref = new reference, fromref is the name of the local reference being pushed, and toref is the name of the remote reference being updated
- Many groups switch to Git because of the ability to have multiple teams working in parallel, whyile merging the different lines of work late in the process.
- The ability of smaller subgroups of a team to collaborate via remote branches without necessarily having to involve or impede the entire team is a huge benefit of Git
- When you rebase a branch, you have to specify the -f(force push option) to your push command in order to be able to replace the featureA branch on the server with a commit that isn't a descendant of it
- If you have a more important project, you might want to use a two-phase merge cycle. In this scenario, you have two long-running branches, master and develop, in which you determine that master is updated only when a very stable release is achieved and all new code is integrated into the develop branch
- GIT CHERRY-PICK: A cherry-pick in Git is like a rebase for a single commit. It takes the patch that was introduced in a commit and tries to reapply it on the branch you are currently on. ONE-COMMIT-REBASE
